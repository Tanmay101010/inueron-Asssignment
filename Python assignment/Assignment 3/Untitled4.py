## Solution 3
year = 2001

# To get year (integer input) from the user
# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# divided by 100 means century year (ending with 00)
# century year divided by 400 is leap year
if (year % 400 == 0) and (year % 100 == 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# year divided by 4 is a leap year
elif (year % 4 ==0) and (year % 100 != 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# if not divided by both 400 (century year) and 4 (not century year)
